# Breakout
My "Star Wars" version of Breakout - Assignment in the course Computer Game Programming at the University of Iceland

## How to play 

Simply open the `index.html` to start playing.

Press key A for the paddle to go left 

Press key D for the paddle to go right 

If you catch the Darth Maul face power-down, the paddle gets smaller.

If you catch the lightsabers power-up, you can press space to shoot lightsabers to break the bricks.
